      <h2 class="text-center my-4">About Me</h2>
      <p>I have been programming on and off almost my entire life. When I was 13, my dad brought home a computer from
        work, but it had no storage drive.
        It only had DOS. I spent many hours learning Basic to try and create something. Unfortunately, anything I made I
        would lose as soon as the
        computer was shut down. I still spent hours on that computer typing away. <br><br>
        After that, my life went down a different path as I graduated high school and then went on to spend 6 years in
        the U.S. Navy as an electrical technician on fast attack submarines operating and maintaining the nuclear power
        plant. I left the military after my initial enlistment and worked for a few years as a technician before
        returning to college for a degree in Computer Information Systems. <br><br>
        After completing my B.S., I decided to learn more about business and planning on combining my information
        knowledge with business knowledge to target a career in digital marketing. I returned to school and completed an
        M.B.A. focused on marketing and information management. <br><br>
        I worked for a while in an operations role before heading out on my own and working as a digital marketing
        consultant and helped found the United States Veterans Chamber of Commerce. During this time, I began reflecting
        over my career and I realized my favorite part of every job I held was writing or troubleshooting code. I was
        always most engaged when working on any program from ladder logic in PLCs, to building marketing segmentation
        algorithms, or working on my hobby and building a world using Unity or Unreal. <br><br>
        I am now continuing down the path that I started early in my life. I realize that I had to go back to the
        beginning to find the path again, but I found it and the am ready for the journey this time.

From here I made recommendations based on the prediction to increase conversion rate.

                        Logistic regression was used to make the predictions.</p>

I looked at how the value of LEGO sets have increased since they were first launched and considered multiple properties of the set to predict whether or not the set would be a good investment. I used the S&P 500 as a benchmark for good investment.  Random Forest Classifier was used to create the model.</p>
